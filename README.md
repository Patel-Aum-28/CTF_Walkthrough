## Introduction

Capture The Flag (CTF) is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants have to solve a series of challenges to find flags, which are unique pieces of information hidden within the challenges. These challenges are designed to test various skills, including web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and more.

This repository serves as a collection of CTF machine walkthroughs that I have written based on my experiences during Solving CTF machines. Each walkthrough will provide step-by-step guidance on how to approach and solve the challenges.
